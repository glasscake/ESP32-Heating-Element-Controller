# ESP32-Heating-Element-Controller
 A project used to control mosfets for body worn heating elements.
 You can easily use any standard replacement / spare heating element sold by many companies for creating DIY heated insoles or glove liners. This project could also be used to replace a dead controller for heated items that are fully integrated like heated socks, vests, helmets, etc. The use of USB-C Power Delivery allows the controller to run directly from a powerbank that can provide the selected voltage. This means your heating element(s) using the standard PD protocol can get 100 watts of heating!

 This project's intention is to be assembled and programed with minimal experience with electronics. The only tools necessary to create your own DIY heating element controller are a soldering iron, the items listed on the BOM (bill of materials), usb-c cable, and a PC. The following instructions will wall you through assembly of the physical board and programming. All assembly can be done with through hole parts.
